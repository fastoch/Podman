# Why stop using Docker?

It's 2024 and there are different container runtimes now.  
Actually, the most popular K8s (Kubernetes) services are not running Docker, the backend runtime is something else.  

These alternatives follow the OCI (**Open Container Initiative**), which was created to **standardize container specifications** so you're 
not locked into one solution.  

A few years ago, Docker decided to monetize their CLI usage.  
For instance, when you use `docker pull` or `docker push` without specifying a registry, the Docker CLI automatically uses Docker Hub.  
And suddenly, companies using Docker Hub started hitting limit rates.  
Sure you can solve this by switching registries and use AWS CCR, Google GCR, GitHub Quay, and a bunch of others.  
But now, you also have to pay if using Docker Desktop for commercial purposes.  

## Podman

Podman does everything Docker does, has a simpler CLI, is faster, safer, and is free for both personal and commercial use.  

Podman is also **daemonless**, which provides: 
- enhanced security
- improved resource management
- greater flexibility

In addition to these advantages, Podman offers compatibility with Docker-based workflows, as it suppors OCI and Docker images.  

Being **daemonless** means that Podman operates without a central daemon or background service.  
Instead, it communicates directly with the Linux kernel and container runtime interface.  

Podman uses **runC** as its **default container runtime**.  
runC is an OCI (Open Container Initiative) compliant runtime that is used to launch containers.  
However, Podman is **flexible** and allows users to change the runtime if desired.
