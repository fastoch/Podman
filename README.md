# Intro

It's 2024 and there are different container runtimes now.  
Actually, the most popular K8s (Kubernetes) services are not running Docker, the backend runtime is something else.  

These alternatives follow the OCI (Open Container Initiative), which was created to standardize container specifications so you're 
not locked into one solution.  

A few years ago, Docker decided to monetize their CLI usage.  
For instance, when you use `docker pull` or `docker push` without specifying a registry, the Docker CLI automatically uses Docker Hub.
